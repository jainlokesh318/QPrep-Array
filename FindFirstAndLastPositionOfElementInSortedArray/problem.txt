Given an array(0-based indexed) of integers nums sorted in ascending order,
find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Input format-
First line has two space seperated integers denoting-
size of array(n) and target value(k)
next line contain n space seperated integers denoting the array.
