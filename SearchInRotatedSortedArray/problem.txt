Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1 and this search has to be done Q times.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Input Format
First line will have a single integer N denoting the size of the array.
Second line will contain N space seperated integers.
Third line will contain a single integer Q.
Next Q line will have a single integer in each line denoting the target value.
