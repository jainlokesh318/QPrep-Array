Given an integer array nums of length N, you need to find one continuous subarray that if you only sort this subarray in ascending order, then the whole array will be sorted in ascending order, too.

You need to find the shortest such subarray and output its length.

Input Format -
First line contains an integer representing the value of N.
Next line contains N space seperated integers representing the array nums.

Constraints-
1 <= N <= 100000
0 <= nums[i] <= 100000

Output Format -
Print a single line integer which represents length of shortest subarray as given in the statement.

Input -
7
2 6 4 8 10 9 15 


Output -
5


Explanation-
You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the whole array sorted in ascending order.
